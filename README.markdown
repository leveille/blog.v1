# Wurdig: My Pylons Powered Blog #

* [Project Description](http://jasonleveille.com/2009/02/graduate-school-independent-study/ "Project Description")
* In short, Wurdig represents my ongoing effort to learn [Pylons](http://pylonshq.com/ "Pylons").  The learning process has taken the shape of [my current blog](http://jasonleveille.com "my current blog")

##Current Release##

There currently is no official release of my blog software.  I have a number of tickets I want to get through before delivering my first official beta release.  Because I do not have an official release, I am not providing installation instructions.  However, if you follow installation instructions found in [The Pylons Book](http://pylonsbook.com/ "The Pylons Book"), you should be able to work through any installation issues.
